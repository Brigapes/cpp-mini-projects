# cpp-mini-projects
Lots of mini projects i made for learning C++. Most of them look like solved assigments and with bad commenting and simply bad code, they were made for sole purpose of learning and getting familiar with C++ programming language. Some comments and in-game commands are in slovene, although that is rare.
